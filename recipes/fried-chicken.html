    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These bang bang chicken nuggets, made from scratch from boneless chicken thighs and breasts, are so much more than your average chicken nugget—so good you might end up calling them bang bang boom boom chicken! Use any extra of the spicy, sweet, tangy bang bang sauce as a dip or sandwich spread—it is delicious!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Nuggets</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts and/or thighs </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons fine dry breadcrumbs</li>
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li> 3 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 3/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons honey, or to taste</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons Sriracha hot sauce, plus more for serving</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground Sichuan pepper(optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut chicken into about 1 to 1 ½- inch pieces; add to the bowl of a food processor. Add bread crumbs, salt, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and the 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the food processor, and pulse on and off until mixture is finely ground, but not yet a smooth puree.</li>
        <li>Scoop 2 tablespoon-sized portions onto a sheet pan, making 24 total. Cover and chill for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, shake self-rising flour and cornstarch together in a bag, and set aside (if using all-purpose flour, add in 1/2 teaspoon baking powder).</li>
        <li>Using slightly damp hands, shape each portion into a ball; add 5 to 6 at a time to the flour mixture in the bag. Toss to coat, shake off excess, and place back on the sheet pan. Once coated, form each into the nugget shape of your choice. A ball shape works well for deep frying; if pan-frying, a flat nugget works best.</li>
        <li>Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 to 2 hours, or until ready to fry. Nuggets can be made a day ahead. </li>
        <li>While nuggets chill, whisk mayonnaise, honey, Sriracha, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and Sichuan pepper together in a bowl; cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Deep fry nuggets until no longer pink at the center and golden brown on the outside, about 4 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C. Alternately, heat oil as needed in a skillet over medium-high heat, and shallow fry until cooked as above, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked nuggets to a mixing bowl, and add half the sliced green onions. Pour in about 1/2 cup sauce, and toss to coat. Extra sauce can be served alongside, or used for other applications—as sandwich spread or as a dip. </li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving platter, top with more Sriracha and remaining green onions. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
